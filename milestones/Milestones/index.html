            <span></span>
            <p>The International Space Station(ISS) is a large spacecraft in orbit around Earth.It serves as a home 
                wherevcrews of astronauts and cosmonauts live.The space station is also a unique science laboratory.
                Several nations worked together to build and use the space station. The space station is made of parts
                that were assembled in space by astronauts. It orbits Earth at an average altitude of approximately 250 
                miles.It travels at 17,500 mph.This means it orbits Earth every 90 minutes. NASA is using the space station
                to learn more about living and working in space.</p>

               Dragon became the first commercially built and operated spacecraft to be recovered successfully from orbit.</p>
